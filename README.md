# nightswitch-lite README

This is a lighter version of [NightSwitch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch) without geolocation. It is much, much smaller because of that. Check out the readme for [NightSwitch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch) for a list of settings and commands, they're all the same. You probably don't want to install both but I'm not your mom.

Note for GitHub: This extension requires the node module `suncalc`. Install it with 
~~~
npm install suncalc
~~~
in this folder.

## Changelog

### 1.0.1
Changes published background color. Whoops!

### 1.0.0
Initial commit. Everything should be the same as with NightSwitch, but without geolocation.
